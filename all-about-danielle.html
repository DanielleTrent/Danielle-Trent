    <h2>About me</h2>    
    <p>I used to work in <em>investment accounting</em>, working with equities and fixed income securities. I liked the work but had to leave for medical reasons. So, I have been out of the workforce for some time. I am better now and want to start a new career. I chose web development because I have found I like it after doing some self-learning. However, I felt I needed more structure. After researching different bootcamps, it seems like <strong>Epicodus</strong> is the best choice. Because for one, the program has pair programming. Working in pairs helps me stay focused on the days work. Also, it is easier to work out bugs with an extra set of eyes and another mind involved. I also think the length of time at Epicodus is more sufficient than just 12 weeks, as I saw for others schools. 12 weeks seems too rushed to be a successful developer. I am alos very interested in participating in the internship. That will give me some real working experience. It is my interest to work in back-end development when I complete this program. </p>
